Configuration file :
Define all the interface:port pairs on which your server will listen to (defining multiple websites served by your program).
	• Set up default error pages.
	• Set the maximum allowed size for client request bodies.
	• Specify rules or configurations on a URL/route (no regex required here), for a website, among the following:
		◦ List of accepted HTTP methods for the route.
		◦ HTTP redirection.
		◦ Directory where the requested file should be located (e.g., if URL /kapouet is rooted to /tmp/www, URL /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet will search for /tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet).
		◦ Enabling or disabling directory listing.
		◦ Default file to serve when the requested resource is a directory.
		◦ Uploading files from the clients to the server is authorized, and storage location is provided.
		◦ Execution of CGI, based on file extension (for example .php). Here are some specific remarks regarding CGIs:
		
∗ Do you wonder what a CGI is?

∗ Have a careful look at the environment variables involved in the web
server-CGI communication. The full request and arguments provided by
the client must be available to the CGI.

∗ Just remember that, for chunked requests, your server needs to un-chunk
them, the CGI will expect EOF as the end of the body.

∗ The same applies to the output of the CGI. If no content_length is
returned from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.

∗ The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.

∗ Your server should support at least one CGI (php-CGI, Python, and so
forth).
